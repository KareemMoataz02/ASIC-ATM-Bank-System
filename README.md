# ASIC ATM Bank System

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Verilog design and verification components for the ASIC ATM Bank System. The project is structured with separate teams for design and verification, following a comprehensive ASIC flow.

### Team Structure
- **Design Team:**
  - System Architect/Design
  - High-Level Model of the System
  - Reference Model
  - Verilog Code

- **Verification Team:**
  - Testbench (Directed, Constraint Random)
  - Self-Checking Testbench using Reference Model
  - Property Specification Language (PSL) assertions
  - Code Coverage (Statement, Branch, FSM)
